# PGMCPP
Probabilistic Graphical Models C++ Implementation
This project's purpose is to provide fundemental algorithms for PGM in C++.
The project is follow the PGM course in Coursera which is conducted by Prof. Daphne Koller.
I'm now providing the following implementations:
1. Factors Operation
2. CliqueTree Calibration
3. Data input from Octave

For Data input from Octave, you need to convert the data to hdf5 format first. I did NOT implement the direct read from .mat file. 
I also did NOT implement the write function for h5 file. Will be get it done later.
